                The assigments consists of creating a poster for the
                2023 Bristol Balloon Fiesta. At first, I was not 
                sure of how to start the project, I made some 
                sketches of my best ideas and I digitalized them using
                Adobe Illustrator. I opted for this final design 
                because the big drawing of the hot air balloon 
                expresses a bold and clear message leaving room for 
                no confussion of what the event is about. The colour 
                palette is inspired by the sunset which I think fits 
                very well for this outdoor summer fiesta. Apart from 
                the complex drawing and styling of the background, the 
                title typeface (Cheap pine) and placement brings a
                layer of simplicity to the design.

                    bear shows up. I like this feature as bears are super cool, but have no issues with eating us like a
                    salmon swimming upstream. </div>
