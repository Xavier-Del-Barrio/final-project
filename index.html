                The assigment consists of creating a poster for the
                2023 Bristol Balloon Fiesta. At first, I was not 
                sure of how to start the project, I made some 
                sketches of my best ideas and I digitalized them using
                Adobe Illustrator. I opted for this final design 
                because the big drawing of the hot air balloon 
                expresses a bold and clear message leaving room for 
                no confussion of what the event is about. The colour 
                palette is inspired by the sunset which I think fits 
                very well for this outdoor summer fiesta. Apart from 
                the complex drawing and styling of the background, the 
                title typeface (Cheap pine) and placement brings a
                layer of simplicity to the design.

                The task was to complete HTML and CSS worksheets
                to learn how to code websites. These very fun
                and hooking tasks have helped me understand and 
                practice coding and thanks to them I have coded 
                this website to show my work. The pictures on 
                the right come from the final result of each 
                worksheet, getting more and more complex.

        <div class="section-five">
            <h2 id="ESSAY_button">Reflection Essay</h2>
            
        <div class="reflection-text">
            <pre>My name is Xavier Del Barrio Pons, I have moved to the UK from Andorra to study Digital Media. Ever since I applied for this undergraduate degree, I knew that
graphic and web design was one of the subjects I wanted to learn the most about, and here I am a few months later and I already coded a website by myself.
                
                The assignment for the semester was to create a website to host all of the tasks and projects we have been
                doing since September.  This included the CARP task, typography tasks, HTML and CSS worksheets.
            
                When I was preparing for the CARP poster, I had some ideas in mind. After transforming my thoughts from rough
                sketches to high quality Adobe illustrator and photoshop images, it was clear which one was more suiting for the
                event to which the poster had to be related to.(Bristol International Balloon Fiesta).
                This poster has it all, the modern yet "fun" design, the "sunset" colour palette...
                To create it, my first step was to gain inspiration for new aspects to consider by using a creative AI tool. This gave me the idea to leave white space 
                so that not only the colours on the poster looked more vibrant but to also simulate clouds in the sky behind illustration of the hot air balloon. 
                From that point I spent many hours learning about the software I was using in order to be able to digitalize my ideas.

With no previous experience in coding, these HTML and CSS worksheets have been precious to my learning.  There was one worksheet per week, these started from the
very basics and each week of progress has led me to being capable of coding and styling my own website. These weekly assignments taught me every step of the way 
by being able to learn new concepts and practice simultaneously.

The typography task is definitely the one that took the most time to complete. I had to come up with 8 different designs using the different typographic systems
learned in class. These are; Axial, Radial, Random, Modular, Transitional, Bilateral, Grid and Dilational.
The task was to create a design for each system using the provided text on a 200mmx200mm canvas on Adobe Illustrator. We were only allowed to use one colour apart
from black.
This was the most challenging task of the semester since there were some typographic systems that were alien to me and my previous experiences. I pleased with the
outcome although in retrospect, I would have wanted to spent some more time on some of the ones that proved to be difficult for me.


This semester has been total adventure for me because I had little to no experience in this field. I am very much happy with the work I am turning in. This journey
has been full of ups and downs (specially when I got frustrated trying to debug my code) although my perseverance and appetite for learning have been able to pull
through and I now feel like I am on top of the mountain of assignments and things to learn that I felt like I had at the beginning of the semester.
