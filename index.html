                The assigment consists of creating a poster for the
                2023 Bristol Balloon Fiesta. At first, I was not 
                sure of how to start the project, I made some 
                sketches of my best ideas and I digitalized them using
                Adobe Illustrator. I opted for this final design 
                because the big drawing of the hot air balloon 
                expresses a bold and clear message leaving room for 
                no confussion of what the event is about. The colour 
                palette is inspired by the sunset which I think fits 
                very well for this outdoor summer fiesta. Apart from 
                the complex drawing and styling of the background, the 
                title typeface (Cheap pine) and placement brings a
                layer of simplicity to the design.

                The task was to complete HTML and CSS worksheets
                to learn how to code websites. These very fun
                and hooking tasks have helped me understand and 
                practice coding and thanks to them I have coded 
                this website to show my work. The pictures on 
                the right come from the final result of each 
                worksheet, getting more and more complex.

                    salmon swimming upstream. </div>
